# NeedForHeat Presence Detector example

This is a [template project](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-presence-detector/generate) that can be used to create firmware for measurement devices that use the [twomes-generic-esp-firmware](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware) library.

## General info
The NeedForHeat Presence Detector primarily serves as an example and template repository how to create firmware that uses the [twomes-generic-esp-firmware](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware) library. Nevertheless, it can be used in  measurement campaigns that require occupancy detection using Bluetooth name requests.

## Measurements

A NeedForHeat Presence Detector measurement device, in addition to [generic data sent by any NeedForHeat measurement device](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware#readme), sends data about the following property via the [NeedForHeat API](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-backoffice-api) to a NeedForHeat server:

| Sensor    | Property       | Unit | [Printf format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) | Default measurement interval \[h:mm:ss\] | Description                                                |
| --------- | -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bluetooth | `occupancy__p` | [-]  | %u                                                                  | 0:10:00                                  | number of smartphones responding to Bluetooth name request |

## Deploying
To deploy this software, see the [deploying section in the twomes-generic-esp-firmware library documentation](https://www.energietransitiewindesheim.nl/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/deploying/prerequisites/). The firmware needed can be found as a [release from this repository](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-presence-detector/releases).

## Developing
To develop software for, or based on this software, see the [developing section in the twomes-generic-esp-firmware library documentation](https://www.energietransitiewindesheim.nl/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/starting/prerequisites/)

## Supported devices
This example was tested on:
- [M5Stack CoreInk](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-CoreInk)

This example still needs to be tested n:
- [LilyGO TTGO T7 Mini32 V1.3 ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3)

## Features
The example features all generic firmware tasks.

Ready:
* Generic firmware tasks using the [twomes-generic-esp-firmware](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware) library, including presence detection based on Bluetooth name requests.
